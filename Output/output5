Classified:    	  The magic lantern probably created by Christiaan Huygens in 1650s could be used to project animation what was achieved by various types of mechanical slides 

Misclassified: 	  Typically two glass slides one with the stationary part of the picture and the other with the part that was to move would be placed one on top of the other and projected together then the moving slide would be hand-operated either directly or by means of lever or other mechanism 

Classified:    	  Chromotrope slides which produced eye-dazzling displays of continuously cycling abstract geometrical patterns and colors were operated by means of small crank and pulley wheel that rotated glass disc 

Misclassified: 	  In the mid-19th century inventions such as the phenakistoscope and zoetrope demonstrated that carefully designed sequence of drawings showing phases of the changing appearance of objects in motion would appear to show the objects actually moving if they were displayed one after the other at sufficiently rapid rate 

Classified:    	  These devices relied on the phenomenon of persistence of vision to make the display appear continuous even though the observer 's view was actually blocked as each drawing rotated into the location where its predecessor had just been glimpsed 

Classified:    	  Each sequence was limited to small number of drawings usually twelve so it could only show endlessly repeating cyclical motions 

Classified:    	  By the late 1880s the last major device of this type the praxinoscope had been elaborated into form that employed long coiled band containing hundreds of images painted on glass and used the elements of magic lantern to project them onto screen 

Classified:    	  The use of sequences of photographs in such devices was initially limited to few experiments with subjects photographed in series of poses because the available emulsions were not sensitive enough to allow the short exposures needed to photograph subjects that were actually moving 

Misclassified: 	  The sensitivity was gradually improved and in the late 1870s Eadweard Muybridge created the first animated image sequences photographed in real-time 

Misclassified: 	  row of cameras was used each in turn capturing one image on glass photographic plate so the total number of images in each sequence was limited by the number of cameras about two dozen at most 

Classified:    	  Muybridge used his system to analyze the movements of wide variety of animal and human subjects 

Classified:    	  Hand-painted images based on the photographs were projected as moving images by means of his zoopraxiscope 

Classified:    	  By the end of the 1880s the introduction of lengths of celluloid photographic film and the invention of motion picture cameras which could photograph an indefinitely long rapid sequence of images using only one lens allowed several minutes of action to be captured and stored on single compact reel of film 

Misclassified: 	  Some early films were made to be viewed by one person at time through `` peep show '' device such as the Kinetoscope 

Classified:    	  Others were intended for projector mechanically similar to the camera and sometimes actually the same machine which was used to shine an intense light through the processed and printed film and into projection lens so that these `` moving pictures '' could be shown tremendously enlarged on screen for viewing by an entire audience 

Classified:    	  The first public exhibition of projected motion pictures in America was at Koster and Bial 's Music Hall in New York City on the 23rd of April 1896 

Classified:    	  The earliest films were simply one static shot that showed an event or action with no editing or other cinematic techniques 

Misclassified: 	  Around the turn of the 20th century films started stringing several scenes together to tell story

Classified:    	  Until sound film became commercially practical in the late 1920s motion pictures were purely visual art but these innovative silent films had gained hold on the public imagination 

Misclassified: 	  Rather than leave audiences with only the noise of the projector as an accompaniment theater owners hired pianist or organist or in large urban theaters full orchestra to play music that fit the mood of the film at any given moment 

Misclassified: 	  By the early 1920s most films came with prepared list of sheet music to be used for this purpose and complete film scores were composed for major productions 

Classified:    	  The rise of European cinema was interrupted by the outbreak of World War while the film industry in the United States flourished with the rise of Hollywood typified most prominently by the innovative work of D. W. Griffith in The Birth of Nation and Intolerance

Murnau and Fritz Lang in many ways inspired by the meteoric wartime progress of film through Griffith along with the contributions of Charles Chaplin Buster Keaton and others quickly caught up with American film-making and continued to further advance the medium 

Classified:    	  In the 1920s the development of electronic sound recording technologies made it practical to incorporate soundtrack of speech music and sound effects synchronized with the action on the screen 

Classified:    	  The resulting sound films were initially distinguished from the usual silent `` moving pictures '' or `` movies '' by calling them `` talking pictures '' or `` talkies

Classified:    	  By 1930 silent film was practically extinct in the US and already being referred to as `` the old medium. `` 

Classified:    	  Another major technological development was the introduction of `` natural color '' which meant color that was photographically recorded from nature rather than added to black-and-white prints by hand-coloring stencil-coloring or other arbitrary procedures although the earliest processes typically yielded colors which were far from `` natural '' in appearance 

Misclassified: 	  While the advent of sound films quickly made silent films and theater musicians obsolete color replaced black-and-white much more gradually 

Classified:    	  The pivotal innovation was the introduction of the three-strip version of the Technicolor process first used for animated cartoons in 1932 then also for live-action short films and isolated sequences in few feature films then for an entire feature film Becky Sharp in 1935 

Classified:    	  The expense of the process was daunting but favorable public response in the form of increased box office receipts usually justified the added cost 

Classified:    	  The number of films made in color slowly increased year after year 

Classified:    	  In the early 1950s the proliferation of black-and-white television started seriously depressing North American theater attendance 

Misclassified: 	  In an attempt to lure audiences back into theaters bigger screens were installed widescreen processes polarized 3D projection and stereophonic sound were introduced and more films were made in color which soon became the rule rather than the exception 

Misclassified: 	  Some important mainstream Hollywood films were still being made in black-and-white as late as the mid-1960s but they marked the end of an era 

Classified:    	  Color television receivers had been available in the US since the mid-1950s but at first they were very expensive and few broadcasts were in color 

Misclassified: 	  During the 1960s prices gradually came down color broadcasts became common and sales boomed 

Classified:    	  The overwhelming public verdict in favor of color was clear

Classified:    	  As with his work on understanding Locke moves from the most basic units of society toward the more elaborate and like Thomas Hobbes he emphasizes the plastic nature of the social contract 

Classified:    	  For an age that had seen absolute monarchy overthrown democracy attempted democracy corrupted and limited monarchy restored only flexible basis for government could be satisfying 

Classified:    	  The Restoration moderated most of the more strident sectarian writing but radicalism persisted after the Restoration 

Classified:    	  Puritan authors such as John Milton were forced to retire from public life or adapt and those Digger Fifth Monarchist Leveller Quaker and Anabaptist authors who had preached against monarchy and who had participated directly in the regicide of Charles were partially suppressed 

Classified:    	  Consequently violent writings were forced underground and many of those who had served in the Interregnum attenuated their positions in the Restoration 

Misclassified: 	  John Bunyan stands out beyond other religious authors of the period 

Classified:    	  Bunyan 's The Pilgrim 's Progress is an allegory of personal salvation and guide to the Christian life 

Misclassified: 	  Instead of any focus on eschatology or divine retribution Bunyan instead writes about how the individual saint can prevail against the temptations of mind and body that threaten damnation 

Classified:    	  The book is written in straightforward narrative and shows influence from both drama and biography and yet it also shows an awareness of the grand allegorical tradition found in Edmund Spenser 

Classified:    	  During the Restoration period the most common manner of getting news would have been broadsheet publication 

Classified:    	  single large sheet of paper might have written usually partisan account of an event 

Classified:    	  However the period saw the beginnings of the first professional and periodical journalism in England 

Classified:    	  Journalism develops late generally around the time of William of Orange 's claiming the throne in 1689 

Classified:    	  Coincidentally or by design England began to have newspapers just when William came to court from Amsterdam where there were already newspapers being published 

Classified:    	  It is impossible to satisfactorily date the beginning of the novel in English 

Classified:    	  However long fiction and fictional biographies began to distinguish themselves from other forms in England during the Restoration period 

Classified:    	  An existing tradition of Romance fiction in France and Spain was popular in England 

Misclassified: 	  The `` Romance '' was considered feminine form and women were taxed with reading `` novels '' as vice 

Misclassified: 	  One of the most significant figures in the rise of the novel in the Restoration period is Aphra Behn 

Classified:    	  She was not only the first professional female novelist but she may be among the first professional novelists of either sex in England 

Classified:    	  Behn 's most famous novel was Oroonoko in 1688 

Classified:    	  This was biography of an entirely fictional African king who had been enslaved in Suriname 

Classified:    	  Behn 's novels show the influence of tragedy and her experiences as dramatist 

Classified:    	  As soon as the previous Puritan regime 's ban on public stage representations was lifted the drama recreated itself quickly and abundantly 

Classified:    	  The most famous plays of the early Restoration period are the unsentimental or `` hard '' comedies of John Dryden William Wycherley and George Etherege which reflect the atmosphere at Court and celebrate an aristocratic macho lifestyle of unremitting sexual intrigue and conquest 

Misclassified: 	  After sharp drop in both quality and quantity in the 1680s the mid-1690s saw brief second flowering of the drama especially comedy 

Misclassified: 	  Comedies like William Congreve 's The Way of the World and John Vanbrugh 's The Relapse and The Provoked Wife were `` softer '' and more middle-class in ethos very different from the aristocratic extravaganza twenty years earlier and aimed at wider audience 

Misclassified: 	  The playwrights of the 1690s set out to appeal to more socially mixed audiences with strong middle-class element and to female spectators for instance by moving the war between the sexes from the arena of intrigue into that of marriage 

Misclassified: 	  The focus in comedy is less on young lovers outwitting the older generation more on marital relations 

Classified:    	  The French Revolution has received enormous amounts of historical attention both from the general public and from scholars and academics 

Misclassified: 	  The views of historians in particular have been characterized as falling along ideological lines with disagreement over the significance and the major developments of the Revolution 

Misclassified: 	  Alexis de Tocqueville argued that the Revolution was manifestation of more prosperous middle class becoming conscious of its social importance 

Classified:    	  Other thinkers like the conservative Edmund Burke maintained that the Revolution was the product of few conspiratorial individuals who brainwashed the masses into subverting the old ordera claim rooted in the belief that the revolutionaries had no legitimate complaints 

Classified:    	  Other historians influenced by Marxist thinking have emphasized the importance of the peasants and the urban workers in presenting the Revolution as gigantic class struggle 

Misclassified: 	  In general scholarship on the French Revolution initially studied the political ideas and developments of the era but it has gradually shifted towards social history that analyzes the impact of the Revolution on individual lives 

Classified:    	  Historians until the late 20th century emphasized class conflicts from largely Marxist perspective as the fundamental driving cause of the Revolution 

Classified:    	  The central theme of this argument was that the Revolution emerged from the rising bourgeoisie with support from the sans-culottes who fought to destroy the aristocracy 

Classified:    	  However Western scholars largely abandoned Marxist interpretations in the 1990s 

Classified:    	  By the year 2000 many historians were saying that the field of the French Revolution was in intellectual disarray 

Classified:    	  The old model or paradigm focusing on class conflict has been discredited and no new explanatory model had gained widespread support 

Classified:    	  Nevertheless as Spang has shown there persists very widespread agreement to the effect that the French Revolution was the watershed between the premodern and modern eras of Western history 

Classified:    	  Historians widely regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in history 

Classified:    	  It marks the end of the early modern period which started around 1500 and is often seen as marking the `` dawn of the modern era '' 

Classified:    	  Within France itself the Revolution permanently crippled the power of the aristocracy and drained the wealth of the Church although the two institutions survived despite the damage they sustained 

Misclassified: 	  After the collapse of the First Empire in 1815 the French public lost the rights and privileges earned since the Revolution but they remembered the participatory politics that characterized the period with one historian commenting `` Thousands of men and even many women gained firsthand experience in the political arena they talked read and listened in new ways they voted they joined new organizations and they marched for their political goals 

Classified:    	  Revolution became tradition and republicanism an enduring option. `` 

Misclassified: 	  Some historians argue that the French people underwent fundamental transformation in self-identity evidenced by the elimination of privileges and their replacement by rights as well as the growing decline in social deference that highlighted the principle of equality throughout the Revolution 

Classified:    	  The Revolution represented the most significant and dramatic challenge to political absolutism up to that point in history and spread democratic ideals throughout Europe and ultimately the world 

Classified:    	  Throughout the 19th Century the revolution was heavily analyzed by economists and political scientists who saw the class nature of the revolution as fundamental aspect in understanding human social evolution itself 

Classified:    	  This combined with the egalitarian values introduced by the revolution gave rise to classless and co-operative model for society called `` socialism '' which profoundly influenced future revolutions in France and around the world 

Classified:    	  Reconstruction began during the war as Lincoln and his associates anticipated questions of how to reintegrate the conquered southern states and how to determine the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves 

Classified:    	  Shortly after Lee 's surrender general had asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated and Lincoln replied `` Let 'em up easy 

Classified:    	  `` In keeping with that sentiment Lincoln led the moderates regarding Reconstruction policy and was opposed by the Radical Republicans under Rep. Thaddeus Stevens Sen. Charles Sumner and Sen. Benjamin Wade political allies of the president on other issues 

Misclassified: 	  Determined to find course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war 

Classified:    	  His Amnesty Proclamation of December 1863 offered pardons to those who had not held Confederate civil office had not mistreated Union prisoners and would sign an oath of allegiance 

Classified:    	  As Southern states were subdued critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re-formed 

Misclassified: 	  Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas where Lincoln appointed Generals Andrew Johnson and Frederick Steele as military governors respectively 

Misclassified: 	  In Louisiana Lincoln ordered General Nathaniel P. Banks to promote plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it 

Misclassified: 	  Lincoln 's Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans political aspirations 

Classified:    	  On the other hand the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient and passed their own plan the Wade-Davis Bill in 1864 

Classified:    	  When Lincoln vetoed the bill the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana Arkansas and Tennessee 

Classified:    	  Lincoln 's appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and Radical factions in harness 

Misclassified: 	  To fill Chief Justice Taney 's seat on the Supreme Court he named the choice of the Radicals Salmon P. Chase who Lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies 

Misclassified: 	  After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation which did not apply to every state Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with constitutional amendment 

Misclassified: 	  Lincoln declared that such an amendment would `` clinch the whole matter '' 

Classified:    	  By December 1863 proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery was brought to Congress for passage 

Classified:    	  This first attempt at an amendment failed to pass falling short of the required two-thirds majority on June 15 1864 in the House of Representatives 

Misclassified: 	  Passage of the proposed amendment became part of the Republican/Unionist platform in the election of 1864 

Classified:    	  After long debate in the House second attempt passed Congress on January 31 1865 and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification 

Misclassified: 	  Upon ratification it became the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution on December 1865 

Misclassified: 	  As the war drew to close Lincoln 's presidential Reconstruction for the South was in flux having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen 

Classified:    	  He signed into law Senator Charles Sumner 's Freedmen 's Bureau bill that set up temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves 

Classified:    	  The law assigned land for lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen 

Classified:    	  Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction 

Misclassified: 	  Shortly before his assassination Lincoln announced he had new plan for southern Reconstruction 

Misclassified: 	  Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states until readmission under the control of southern Unionists 

Classified:    	  Historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly what Lincoln would have done about Reconstruction if he had lived but they make projections based on his known policy positions and political acumen 

Classified:    	  Lincoln biographers James G. Randall and Richard Current according to David Lincove argue that It is likely that had he lived Lincoln would have followed policy similar to Johnson 's that he would have clashed with congressional Radicals that he would have produced better result for the freedmen than occurred and that his political skills would have helped him avoid Johnson 's mistakes 

Classified:    	  Unlike Sumner and other Radicals Lincoln did not see Reconstruction as an opportunity for sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation 

Classified:    	  He had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land 

Classified:    	  He believed as most Republicans did in April 1865 that the voting requirements should be determined by the states 

Classified:    	  He assumed that political control in the South would pass to white Unionists reluctant secessionists and forward-looking former Confederates 

Classified:    	  But time and again during the war Lincoln after initial opposition had come to embrace positions first advanced by abolitionists and Radical Republicans 

Classified:    	  Lincoln undoubtedly would have listened carefully to the outcry for further protection for the former slaves 

Misclassified: 	  It is entirely plausible to imagine Lincoln and Congress agreeing on Reconstruction policy that encompassed federal protection for basic civil rights plus limited black suffrage along the lines Lincoln proposed just before his death. ``

Misclassified: 	  After an advance as far as 14 miles German resistance stiffened and the battle was concluded on 12 August 

Classified:    	  Rather than continuing the Amiens battle past the point of initial success as had been done so many times in the past the Allies shifted their attention elsewhere 

Classified:    	  Allied leaders had now realised that to continue an attack after resistance had hardened was waste of lives and it was better to turn line than to try to roll over it 

Classified:    	  They began to undertake attacks in quick order to take advantage of successful advances on the flanks then broke them off when each attack lost its initial impetus

Misclassified: 	  Further terminology is used to distinguish various forms and media of film industry 

Misclassified: 	  `` Motion pictures '' and `` moving pictures '' are frequently-used terms for film and movie productions specifically intended for theatrical exhibition such as for instance Batman 

Misclassified: 	  `` DVD '' and `` videotape '' are video formats that can reproduce photochemical film 

Misclassified: 	  reproduction based on such is called `` transfer. `` 

Misclassified: 	  After the advent of theatrical film as an industry the television industry began using videotape as recording medium 

Classified:    	  For many decades tape was solely an analog medium onto which moving images could be either recorded or transferred 

Misclassified: 	  `` Film '' and `` filming '' refer to the photochemical medium that chemically records visual image and the act of recording respectively 

Classified:    	  However the act of shooting images with other visual media such as with digital camera is still called `` filming '' and the resulting works often called `` films '' as interchangeable to `` movies '' despite not being shot on film 

Misclassified: 	  `` Silent films '' need not be utterly silent but are films and movies without an audible dialogue including those that have musical accompaniment 

Misclassified: 	  The word `` Talkies '' refers to the earliest sound films created to have audible dialogue recorded for playback along with the film regardless of musical accompaniment

Misclassified: 	  cinema usually refers to an arena designed specifically to exhibit films where the screen is affixed to wall while theater usually refers to place where live non-recorded action or combination thereof occurs from podium or other type of stage including the amphitheater 

Classified:    	  Theaters can still screen movies in them though the theater would be retrofitted to do so 

Misclassified: 	  One might propose `` going to the cinema '' when referring to the activity or sometimes `` to the pictures '' in British English whereas the U. S. expression is usually `` going to the movies. `` 

Classified:    	  cinema usually shows mass-marketed movie using front-projection screen process with either film projector or more recently with digital projector 

Classified:    	  But cinemas may also show theatrical movies from their home video transfers that include Blu-ray Disc DVD and videocassette when they possess sufficient projection quality or based upon need such as movies that exist only in their transferred state which may be due to the loss or deterioration of the film master and prints from which the movie originally existed

Classified:    	  Britain entered the war with confidence it had the world 's most powerful navy well-trained professional army sound financial system that could pay the costs stable government and experienced leadership 

Classified:    	  However they were beset with major challenges 

Misclassified: 	  Compared to the Americans the British had no major allies and only had troops provided by small German states to bolster the small British Army 

Classified:    	  At the onset of the war the British Army was less than 48,000 strong worldwide and suffered from lack of effective recruiting 

Classified:    	  By 1778 the army was pardoning criminals for military service and had extended the age range for service to be from 16 to 50 

Classified:    	  Although its officer and non-commissioned officer corps were relatively professional and experienced this professionalism was diluted because wealthy individuals lacking military experience could purchase commissions and promotions 

Classified:    	  As consequence inexperienced officers sometimes found their way into positions of high responsibility 

Classified:    	  Distance was also major problem for the British 

Misclassified: 	  Although the Royal Navy was the largest and most experienced in the world at the time it sometimes took months for troops to reach North America and orders were often out of date because the military situation on the ground had changed by the time they arrived 

Classified:    	  Additionally the British had logistical problems whenever they operated away from the coast they were vulnerable to guerilla attacks on their supply chains whenever they went far inland 

Classified:    	  On logistical note the flints used in British weapons also put them at disadvantage on the battlefield 

Misclassified: 	  British flints could only fire for rounds before requiring re-sharpening while American flints could fire 60 rounds before resharpening 

Classified:    	  common expression ran among the redcoats which was that `` Yankee flint was as good as glass of grog. `` 

Classified:    	  Although discipline was harsh in the army the redcoats had little self-discipline gambling looting promiscuity and heavy drinking were common problems among all ranks alike 

Misclassified: 	  The army suffered from mediocre organisation in terms of logistics food supplies were often bad and the sparse land of America offered little in the way of finding reliable substitutes 

Classified:    	  Suppressing rebellion in America also posed other problems 

Classified:    	  At the onset of the war the British had around 8,000 men stationed in North America however these were required to cover an area that stretched from northern Canada to Florida distance of almost 2,000 miles 

Classified:    	  As the colonies had not been united before the war there was no central area of strategic importance 

Misclassified: 	  In European conflicts the capture of capital city often meant the end of the war however in America when the British seized key cities such as New York Philadelphia or Bostonor Washington D. C. in the War of 1812 thirty years laterthe war continued unabated 

Classified:    	  Furthermore despite the fact that at its height the British fielded some 56,000 men in the colonies exclusive of mercenaries and militia they lacked the sufficient numbers to both defeat the Americans on the battlefield and simultaneously occupy the captured areas 

Classified:    	  It was not unusual for the Americans to suffer string of defeats only to have the British retreat because they could not occupy the captured land 

Classified:    	  Despite strong Loyalist support these troops were often displaced by Patriot militia when British regulars were not in the area demonstrated at battles such as Kings Mountain 

Classified:    	  The manpower shortage became critical when France Spain and the Netherlands entered the war as the British were spread across several theatres worldwide when before they were concentrated only in America 

Classified:    	  The British also had to contend with several psychological factors during the conflict 

Misclassified: 	  The need to maintain Loyalist allegiance provided setbacks as the British could not use the harsh methods of suppressing rebellion they had used in Ireland and Scotland 

Classified:    	  Loyalists often came from the same communities as Patriots and as result such methods could not be employed for fear of alienating them 

Classified:    	  Even despite these limitations neutral colonists were often driven into the ranks of the Revolutionaries due to the conflict such as the war in the Carolinas marked by heavy brutality on both sides 

Misclassified: 	  As result of the manpower shortage and Patriot control of the countryside where the majority of the American population lived the British often could not simultaneously defeat the Americans on the field and occupy the captured areas evidenced by withdrawals from Philadelphia and the Carolinas after great initial success 

Misclassified: 	  single American victory could often reverse the impact of string of British successes as shown by engagements at Trenton Bennington King 's Mountain and even defeats such as Germantown all of which went long way to galvanizing Patriot support for the war and of persuading European powers such as France and Spain to support the rebellion 

Misclassified: 	  Early in 1775 the British Army consisted of about 36,000 men worldwide but wartime recruitment steadily increased this number 

Misclassified: 	  Great Britain had difficult time appointing general officers however 

Misclassified: 	  General Thomas Gage in command of British forces in North America when the rebellion started was criticized for being too lenient 

Misclassified: 	  General Jeffrey Amherst 1st Baron Amherst turned down an appointment as commander in chief due to an unwillingness to take sides in the conflict 

Classified:    	  Similarly Admiral Augustus Keppel turned down command saying `` can not draw the sword in such cause. `` 

Classified:    	  The Earl of Effingham publicly resigned his commission when his 22nd Regiment of foot was posted to America and William Howe and John Burgoyne were members of parliament who opposed military solutions to the American rebellion 

Classified:    	  Howe and Henry Clinton stated that they were unwilling participants in the war and were only following orders 

Classified:    	  The British Parliament was also far from united in supporting military opposition to the American Patriots 

Classified:    	  Lord North held the post of Prime Minister with Tory majority backing him advocating military suppression of the American rebellion 

Classified:    	  However they were constantly and vehemently opposed by large Whig minority with politicians such as Charles James Fox and Edmund Burke of the Rockingham Whigs fiercely voicing their derision of pursuing military solutions to the rebellion 

Classified:    	  The Whigs gained prominence in Parliament as the British suffered strategic defeats at Saratoga and later at Yorktown resulting in the collapse of Lord North 's ministry 

Misclassified: 	  Over the course of the war Great Britain signed treaties with various German states which supplied about 30,000 soldiers 

Classified:    	  Germans made up about one-third of the British troop strength in North America 

Misclassified: 	  The Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel contributed more soldiers than any other state and German soldiers became known as `` Hessians '' to the Americans 

Classified:    	  Revolutionary speakers called German soldiers `` foreign mercenaries '' and they are scorned as such in the Declaration of Independence 

Classified:    	  By 1779 the number of British and German troops stationed in North America was over 60,000 although these were spread from Canada to Florida 

Classified:    	  Initially several German principalities offered military support to Great Britain but these offers were rejected 

Classified:    	  However as the war dragged on it became clear that Great Britain would need the extra manpower of the German states and led to Great Britain seeking support from German principalities such as Hesse-Kassel and Ansbach-Bayreuth 

Classified:    	  The Secretary of State at War Lord Barrington and the Adjutant-General Edward Harvey were both strongly opposed to outright war on land 

Classified:    	  In 1766 Barrington had recommended withdrawing the army from the Thirteen Colonies to Canada Nova Scotia and Florida 

Classified:    	  At the beginning of the war he urged naval blockade which would quickly damage the colonists trading activities 

Classified:    	  Upon taking power in Russia Lenin believed that key policy of his government must be to withdraw from the ongoing First World War by establishing an armistice with the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary 

Classified:    	  He believed that ongoing war would generate increasing resentment among war-weary Russian troops to whom he had promised peace and that both these troops and the advancing German Army posed threat both to the future of his own government and to international socialism 

Misclassified: 	  Other Bolsheviks in particular Bukharin and the Left Communists viewed things differently believing that peace with the Central Powers would be betrayal of international socialism and that Russia should instead wage `` war of revolutionary defense '' that they believed would provoke an uprising of the German proletariat against their nation 's government 

Classified:    	  Lenin proposed three-month armistice in his Decree on Peace which was then approved by the Second Congress of Soviets and presented to the German and Austro-Hungarian governments 

Classified:    	  The Germans responded positively viewing this as an opportunity to focus their attentions on the Western Front and stave off looming defeat 

Classified:    	  In November armistice talks began at Brest-Litovsk the headquarters of the German high command on the Eastern Front with the Russian delegation being led by Adolph Joffe and Leon Trotsky 

Classified:    	  Meanwhile ceasefire designed to last until January was agreed 

Misclassified: 	  During negotiations the Germans insisted on keeping their wartime conquests which included Poland Lithuania and Courland whereas the Russians countered that this was violation of these nations rights to self-determination 

Misclassified: 	  There had been hopes among the Bolsheviks that the armistice negotiations could be dragged out indefinitely until such time as proletarian revolution would break out throughout Europe 

Misclassified: 	  On January 1918 Trotsky returned from Brest Litovsk to St. Petersburg informing the government that the Central Powers had presented them with an ultimatum either they accept Germany 's territorial demands or the war would resume 

Classified:    	  On January Lenin spoke to the Third All-Russian Congress of Soviets urging delegates to accept Germany 's proposals he argued that the territorial losses were acceptable if it ensured the survival of the Bolshevik-led government however the majority of Bolsheviks rejected his position hoping to prolong the armistice 

Classified:    	  On 10 February the Central Powers issued second ultimatum and while Lenin again urged acceptance the Bolshevik Central Committee retained its original position hoping to call Germany 's bluff 

Misclassified: 	  On 18 February the German Army relaunched the offensive advancing further into Russian-controlled territory and within day conquering Dvinsk 

Classified:    	  At this point Lenin finally convinced small majority of the Bolshevik Central Committee to accept the Central Powers demands 

Classified:    	  On 23 February the Central Powers issued new ultimatum the Russian government would recognise German control not only of Poland and the Baltic states but also Ukraine else they would face full-scale invasion of Russia itself 

Classified:    	  On March the Treaty of Brest Litovsk was signed

Classified:    	  Accordingly the Treaty was deeply unpopular across the political spectrum within Russia 

Classified:    	  Several Bolsheviks and Left Socialist Revolutionaries resigned from Sovnarkom in protest 

Misclassified: 	  After the Treaty was signed Sovnarkom focused its attentions on attempting to foment proletarian revolution in Germany issuing an array of anti-war and anti-government publications in the country the German government retaliated by expelling Russia 's representatives 

Classified:    	  However that month Wilhelm II the German Emperor resigned and the country 's new administration signed the Armistice of 11 November 1918

Classified:    	  Furthermore the Italian city-states constantly engaged one another in bloody warfare sometimes forming uneasy alliances but ultimately failing to unify against outside foreign powers 

Classified:    	  The tension and violent rivalry among the Italian city-states culminated in the Italian Wars of the 15th and 16th centuries series of wars and foreign invasions that left the Italian states vulnerable to annexation by neighboring European powers 

Misclassified: 	  Italy would remain politically fragmented and fall prey to occupation colonization conquest and general foreign domination by European powers such as France Spain and later Austria subsequently remaining divided into various subjugated client states or territories of dominant foreign powers and entering long period of decline that lasted until the mid-19th century
