Classified:    	  Various dates are given for the Romantic period in British literature but here the publishing of Lyrical Ballads in 1798 is taken as the beginning and the crowning of Queen Victoria in 1837 as its end even though for example William Wordsworth lived until 1850 and both Robert Burns and William Blake published before 1798 

Classified:    	  The writers of this period however `` did not think of themselves as 'Romantics `` and the term was first used by critics of the Victorian period 

Classified:    	  Romanticism arrived later in other parts of the English-speaking world 

Classified:    	  The Romantic period was one of major social change in England because of the depopulation of the countryside and the rapid development of overcrowded industrial cities that took place in the period roughly between 1750 and 1850 

Classified:    	  The movement of so many people in England was the result of two forces the Agricultural Revolution that involved the Enclosure of the land drove workers off the land and the Industrial Revolution which provided them employment `` in the factories and mills operated by machines driven by steam-power '' 

Classified:    	  Indeed Romanticism may be seen in part as reaction to the Industrial Revolution though it was also revolt against aristocratic social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment as well reaction against the scientific rationalization of nature 

Classified:    	  The French Revolution was an especially important influence on the political thinking of many of the Romantic poets 

Classified:    	  The landscape is often prominent in the poetry of this period so much so that the Romantics especially perhaps Wordsworth are often described as 'nature poets 

Classified:    	  However the longer Romantic 'nature poems have wider concern because they are usually meditations on `` an emotional problem or personal crisis '' 

Misclassified: 	  Robert Burns was pioneer of the Romantic movement and after his death he became cultural icon in Scotland

Misclassified: 	  The landline telephone contains switchhook and an alerting device usually ringer that remains connected to the phone line whenever the phone is `` on hook '' is open and other components which are connected when the phone is `` off hook '' 

Misclassified: 	  The off-hook components include transmitter receiver and other circuits for dialing filtering and amplification 

Classified:    	  calling party wishing to speak to another party will pick up the telephone 's handset thereby operating lever which closes the switchhook which powers the telephone by connecting the transmitter receiver and related audio components to the line 

Misclassified: 	  The off-hook circuitry has low resistance which causes direct current which comes down the line from the telephone exchange 

Classified:    	  The exchange detects this current attaches digit receiver circuit to the line and sends dial tone to indicate readiness 

Misclassified: 	  On modern push-button telephone the caller then presses the number keys to send the telephone number of the called party 

Classified:    	  The keys control tone generator circuit that makes DTMF tones that the exchange receives 

Misclassified: 	  rotary-dial telephone uses pulse dialing sending electrical pulses that the exchange can count to get the telephone number 

Classified:    	  If the called party 's line is available the exchange sends an intermittent ringing signal in North America and UK and 60 volts in Germany to alert the called party to an incoming call 

Classified:    	  If the called party 's line is in use the exchange returns busy signal to the calling party 

Classified:    	  However if the called party 's line is in use but has call waiting installed the exchange sends an intermittent audible tone to the called party to indicate an incoming call 

Misclassified: 	  The ringer of telephone is connected to the line through capacitor which blocks direct current but passes the alternating current of the ringing signal 

Misclassified: 	  The telephone draws no current when it is on hook while DC voltage is continually applied to the line 

Misclassified: 	  Exchange circuitry can send an AC current down the line to activate the ringer and announce an incoming call 

Misclassified: 	  When there is no automatic exchange telephones have hand-cranked magnetos to generate ringing voltage back to the exchange or any other telephone on the same line 

Misclassified: 	  When landline telephone is inactive the circuitry at the telephone exchange detects the absence of direct current to indicate that the line is not in use 

Classified:    	  When party initiates call to this line the exchange sends the ringing signal 

Classified:    	  When the called party picks up the handset they actuate double-circuit switchhook which may simultaneously disconnects the alerting device and connects the audio circuitry to the line 

Classified:    	  This in turn draws direct current through the line confirming that the called phone is now active 

Classified:    	  The exchange circuitry turns off the ring signal and both telephones are now active and connected through the exchange 

Classified:    	  The parties may now converse as long as both phones remain off hook 

Classified:    	  When party hangs up placing the handset back on the cradle or hook direct current ceases in that line signaling the exchange to disconnect the call 

Classified:    	  Calls to parties beyond the local exchange are carried over trunk lines which establish connections between exchanges 

Classified:    	  In modern telephone networks fiber-optic cable and digital technology are often employed in such connections 

Classified:    	  Satellite technology may be used for communication over very long distances 

Misclassified: 	  In most landline telephones the transmitter and receiver are located in the handset although in speakerphone these components may be located in the base or in separate enclosure 

Classified:    	  Powered by the line the microphone produces modulated electric current which varies its frequency and amplitude in response to the sound waves arriving at its diaphragm 

Classified:    	  The resulting current is transmitted along the telephone line to the local exchange then on to the other phone where it passes through the coil of the receiver 

Classified:    	  The varying current in the coil produces corresponding movement of the receiver 's diaphragm reproducing the original sound waves present at the transmitter 

Classified:    	  Along with the microphone and speaker additional circuitry is incorporated to prevent the incoming speaker signal and the outgoing microphone signal from interfering with each other 

Classified:    	  This is accomplished through hybrid coil 

Classified:    	  The incoming audio signal passes through resistor and the primary winding of the coil which passes it to the speaker 

Misclassified: 	  Since the current path A8 A3 has far lower impedance than the microphone virtually all of the incoming signal passes through it and bypasses the microphone 

Classified:    	  At the same time the DC voltage across the line causes DC current which is split between the resistor-coil branch and the microphone-coil branch 

Classified:    	  The DC current through the resistor-coil branch has no effect on the incoming audio signal 

Classified:    	  But the DC current passing through the microphone is turned into AC current which then passes through only the upper branch of the coil 's primary winding which has far fewer turns than the lower primary winding 

Classified:    	  This causes small portion of the microphone output to be fed back to the speaker while the rest of the AC current goes out through the phone line 

Classified:    	  After reading Schopenhauer 's The World as Will and Representation Tolstoy gradually became converted to the ascetic morality upheld in that work as the proper spiritual path for the upper classes `` Do you know what this summer has meant for me

Classified:    	  It explained how the nothingness that results from complete denial of self is only relative nothingness and is not to be feared 

Classified:    	  The novelist was struck by the description of Christian Buddhist and Hindu ascetic renunciation as being the path to holiness 

Classified:    	  After reading passages such as the following which abound in Schopenhauer 's ethical chapters the Russian nobleman chose poverty and formal denial of the will But this very necessity of involuntary suffering for eternal salvation is also expressed by that utterance of the Savior `` It is easier for camel to go through the eye of needle than for rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. `` 

Classified:    	  Therefore those who were greatly in earnest about their eternal salvation chose voluntary poverty when fate had denied this to them and they had been born in wealth 

Classified:    	  Thus Buddha Sakyamuni was born prince but voluntarily took to the mendicant 's staff and Francis of Assisi the founder of the mendicant orders who as youngster at ball where the daughters of all the notabilities were sitting together was asked `` Now Francis will you not soon make your choice from these beauties ''

Classified:    	  Tolstoy also received letters from American Quakers who introduced him to the non-violence writings of Quaker Christians such as George Fox William Penn and Jonathan Dymond 

Classified:    	  Tolstoy believed being Christian required him to be pacifist the consequences of being pacifist and the apparently inevitable waging of war by government are the reason why he is considered philosophical anarchist 

Misclassified: 	  Later various versions of `` Tolstoy 's Bible '' would be published indicating the passages Tolstoy most relied on specifically the reported words of Jesus himself 

Classified:    	  Tolstoy believed that true Christian could find lasting happiness by striving for inner self-perfection through following the Great Commandment of loving one 's neighbor and God rather than looking outward to the Church or state for guidance 

Classified:    	  His belief in nonresistance when faced by conflict is another distinct attribute of his philosophy based on Christ 's teachings 

Classified:    	  By directly influencing Mahatma Gandhi with this idea through his work The Kingdom of God Is Within You Tolstoy 's profound influence on the nonviolent resistance movement reverberates to this day 

Classified:    	  He believed that the aristocracy were burden on the poor and that the only solution to how we live together is through anarchism 

Classified:    	  He also opposed private property in land ownership and the institution of marriage and valued the ideals of chastity and sexual abstinence ideals also held by the young Gandhi 

Misclassified: 	  Tolstoy 's later work derives passion and verve from the depth of his austere moral views 

Classified:    	  The sequence of the temptation of Sergius in Father Sergius for example is among his later triumphs 

Misclassified: 	  Gorky relates how Tolstoy once read this passage before himself and Chekhov and that Tolstoy was moved to tears by the end of the reading

Misclassified: 	  With all the might of his talent Tolstoy made powerful criticism of the church the state and law altogether and especially of the present property laws 

Classified:    	  He describes the state as the domination of the wicked ones supported by brutal force 

Classified:    	  Robbers he says are far less dangerous than well-organized government 

Classified:    	  He makes searching criticism of the prejudices which are current now concerning the benefits conferred upon men by the church the state and the existing distribution of property and from the teachings of Jesus he deduces the rule of non-resistance and the absolute condemnation of all wars

Classified:    	  He spoke of great admiration of Henry George stating once that `` People do not argue with the teaching of George they simply do not know it 

Classified:    	  And it is impossible to do otherwise with his teaching for he who becomes acquainted with it can not but agree 

Classified:    	  `` He also wrote preface to George 's Social Problems 

Classified:    	  Tolstoy and George both rejected private property in land whilst simultaneously both rejecting centrally planned socialist economy 

Classified:    	  Some assume that this development in Tolstoy 's thinking was move away from his anarchist views since Georgism requires central administration to collect land rent and spend it on infrastructure 

Classified:    	  However anarchist versions of Georgism have also been proposed since 

Classified:    	  Tolstoy 's 1899 novel Resurrection explores his thoughts on Georgism in more detail and hints that Tolstoy indeed had such view 

Classified:    	  It suggests the possibility of small communities with some form of local governance to manage the collective land rents for common goods whilst still heavily criticising institutions of the state such as the justice system 

Classified:    	  The People 's Republic of China was established on October 1949 

Classified:    	  It was the culmination of over two decades of civil and international wars 

Misclassified: 	  Mao famously announced `` We have stood up. `` 

Classified:    	  Mao took up residence in Zhongnanhai compound next to the Forbidden City in Beijing and there he ordered the construction of an indoor swimming pool and other buildings 

Classified:    	  Mao 's physician Li Zhisui described him as conducting business either in bed or by the side of the pool preferring not to wear formal clothes unless absolutely necessary 

Classified:    	  Li 's book The Private Life of Chairman Mao is regarded as controversial especially by those sympathetic to Mao 

Classified:    	  In October 1950 Mao made the decision to send the People 's Volunteer Army special unit of the People 's Liberation Army China 's armed forces into the war in Korea and fight against the United Nations forces and the South Korean armies led by the U. S. as well as to reinforce the armed forces of North Korea the Korean People 's Army which had been in full retreat 

Misclassified: 	  Historical records showed that Mao directed the PVA campaigns in the Korean War to the minute details as Chairman of the ruling CPC 's Central Military Commission that oversees the country 's armed forces 

Classified:    	  Because he was the Chairman of the CPC 's CMC he was also the Supreme Commander in Chief of the PLA aside from being the Chairman of the People 's Republic and Chairman of the ruling CPC 

Misclassified: 	  The PVA was under the overall command of then newly installed Premier Zhou Enlai and with General Peng Dehuai as field commander and political commissar as well 

Misclassified: 	  Along with land reform during which significant numbers of landlords and well-to-do peasants were beaten to death at mass meetings organised by the Communist Party as land was taken from them and given to poorer peasants there was also the Campaign to Suppress Counter-revolutionaries which involved public executions targeting mainly former Kuomintang officials businessmen accused of `` disturbing '' the market former employees of Western companies and intellectuals whose loyalty was suspect 

Misclassified: 	  The U. S. State department in 1976 estimated that there may have been million killed in the land reform and 800,000 killed in the counter-revolutionary campaign 

Misclassified: 	  Mao himself claimed that total of 700,000 people were killed in attacks on `` counter-revolutionaries '' during the years 195052 

Misclassified: 	  However because there was policy to select `` at least one landlord and usually several in virtually every village for public execution '' the number of deaths range between million and million 

Classified:    	  In addition at least 

Classified:    	  million people perhaps as many as to million were sent to `` reform through labour '' camps where many perished 

Misclassified: 	  Mao played personal role in organizing the mass repressions and established system of execution quotas which were often exceeded 

Classified:    	  He defended these killings as necessary for the securing of power 

Classified:    	  Starting in 1951 Mao initiated two successive movements in an effort to rid urban areas of corruption by targeting wealthy capitalists and political opponents known as the three-anti/five-anti campaigns 

Classified:    	  Whereas the three-anti campaign was focused purge of government industrial and party officials the five-anti campaign set its sights slightly broader targeting capitalist elements in general 

Classified:    	  Workers denounced their bosses spouses turned on their spouses and children informed on their parents the victims were often humiliated at struggle sessions method designed to intimidate and terrify people to the maximum 

Classified:    	  Mao insisted that minor offenders be criticised and reformed or sent to labour camps `` while the worst among them should be shot '' 

Classified:    	  These campaigns took several hundred thousand additional lives the vast majority via suicide 

Misclassified: 	  In Shanghai suicide by jumping from tall buildings became so commonplace that residents avoided walking on the pavement near skyscrapers for fear that suicides might land on them 

Misclassified: 	  Some biographers have pointed out that driving those perceived as enemies to suicide was common tactic during the Mao-era 

Misclassified: 	  For example in his biography of Mao Philip Short notes that in the Yan'an Rectification Movement Mao gave explicit instructions that `` no cadre is to be killed '' but in practice allowed security chief Kang Sheng to drive opponents to suicide and that `` this pattern was repeated throughout his leadership of the People 's Republic. `` 

Misclassified: 	  Following the consolidation of power Mao launched the First Five-Year Plan 

Misclassified: 	  The plan aimed to end Chinese dependence upon agriculture in order to become world power 

Classified:    	  With the Soviet Union 's assistance new industrial plants were built and agricultural production eventually fell to point where industry was beginning to produce enough capital that China no longer needed the USSR 's support 

Classified:    	  The success of the First-Five Year Plan was to encourage Mao to instigate the Second Five-Year Plan in 1958 

Classified:    	  Mao also launched phase of rapid collectivization 

Classified:    	  The CPC introduced price controls as well as Chinese character simplification aimed at increasing literacy 

Classified:    	  Large-scale industrialization projects were also undertaken 

Classified:    	  Programs pursued during this time include the Hundred Flowers Campaign in which Mao indicated his supposed willingness to consider different opinions about how China should be governed 

Misclassified: 	  Given the freedom to express themselves liberal and intellectual Chinese began opposing the Communist Party and questioning its leadership 

Classified:    	  This was initially tolerated and encouraged 

Classified:    	  After few months Mao 's government reversed its policy and persecuted those totalling perhaps 500,000 who criticised as well as those who were merely alleged to have criticised the party in what is called the Anti-Rightist Movement 

Classified:    	  Authors such as Jung Chang have alleged that the Hundred Flowers Campaign was merely ruse to root out `` dangerous '' thinking 

Classified:    	  Li Zhisui Mao 's physician suggested that Mao had initially seen the policy as way of weakening those within his party who opposed him and was surprised by the extent of criticism and the fact that it began to be directed at his own leadership 

Classified:    	  It was only then that he used it as method of identifying and subsequently persecuting those critical of his government 

Misclassified: 	  The Hundred Flowers movement led to the condemnation silencing and death of many citizens also linked to Mao 's Anti-Rightist Movement with death tolls possibly in the millions

Misclassified: 	  The brazen reorganization of German territory by the French risked threatening Prussian influence in the region if not eliminating it outright 

Classified:    	  War fever in Berlin rose steadily throughout the summer of 1806 

Classified:    	  At the insistence of his court especially his wife Queen Louise Frederick William III decided to challenge the French domination of Central Europe by going to war 

Misclassified: 	  The initial military maneuvers began in September 1806 

Classified:    	  In notable letter to Marshal Soult detailing the plan for the campaign Napoleon described the essential features of Napoleonic warfare and introduced the phrase le bataillon-carr 

Classified:    	  In the bataillon-carr system the various corps of the Grande Arme would march uniformly together in close supporting distance 

Classified:    	  If any single corps was attacked the others could quickly spring into action and arrive to help 

Classified:    	  Napoleon invaded Prussia with 180,000 troops rapidly marching on the right bank of the River Saale 

Classified:    	  As in previous campaigns his fundamental objective was to destroy one opponent before reinforcements from another could tip the balance of the war 

Misclassified: 	  Upon learning the whereabouts of the Prussian army the French swung westwards and crossed the Saale with overwhelming force 

Classified:    	  At the twin battles of Jena and Auerstedt fought on 14 October the French convincingly defeated the Prussians and inflicted heavy casualties 

Misclassified: 	  With several major commanders dead or incapacitated the Prussian king proved incapable of effectively commanding the army which began to quickly disintegrate 

Classified:    	  In vaunted pursuit that epitomized the `` peak of Napoleonic warfare '' according to historian Richard Brooks the French managed to capture 140,000 soldiers over 2,000 cannons and hundreds of ammunition wagons all in single month 

Classified:    	  Historian David Chandler wrote of the Prussian forces `` Never has the morale of any army been more completely shattered 

Misclassified: 	  `` Despite their overwhelming defeat the Prussians refused to negotiate with the French until the Russians had an opportunity to enter the fight

Classified:    	  The Continental System which prohibited European nations from trading with Britain was widely violated throughout his reign 

Classified:    	  In the next few months Napoleon marched against the advancing Russian armies through Poland and was involved in the bloody stalemate at the Battle of Eylau in February 1807 

Classified:    	  After period of rest and consolidation on both sides the war restarted in June with an initial struggle at Heilsberg that proved indecisive 

Misclassified: 	  On 14 June however Napoleon finally obtained an overwhelming victory over the Russians at the Battle of Friedland wiping out the majority of the Russian army in very bloody struggle 

Classified:    	  The scale of their defeat convinced the Russians to make peace with the French 

Classified:    	  On 19 June Czar Alexander sent an envoy to seek an armistice with Napoleon 

Classified:    	  The latter assured the envoy that the Vistula River represented the natural borders between French and Russian influence in Europe 

Classified:    	  On that basis the two emperors began peace negotiations at the town of Tilsit after meeting on an iconic raft on the River Niemen 

Misclassified: 	  The very first thing Alexander said to Napoleon was probably well-calibrated `` hate the English as much as you do 

Misclassified: 	  `` Alexander faced pressure from his brother Duke Constantine to make peace with Napoleon 

Classified:    	  Given the victory he had just achieved the French emperor offered the Russians relatively lenient termsdemanding that Russia join the Continental System withdraw its forces from Wallachia and Moldavia and hand over the Ionian Islands to France 

Misclassified: 	  By contrast Napoleon dictated very harsh peace terms for Prussia despite the ceaseless exhortations of Queen Louise 

Misclassified: 	  Wiping out half of Prussian territories from the map Napoleon created new kingdom of 1,100 square miles called Westphalia 

Classified:    	  He then appointed his young brother Jrme as the new monarch of this kingdom 

Classified:    	  Prussia 's humiliating treatment at Tilsit caused deep and bitter antagonism which festered as the Napoleonic era progressed 

Misclassified: 	  Moreover Alexander 's pretensions at friendship with Napoleon led the latter to seriously misjudge the true intentions of his Russian counterpart who would violate numerous provisions of the treaty in the next few years 

Classified:    	  Despite these problems the Treaties of Tilsit at last gave Napoleon respite from war and allowed him to return to France which he had not seen in over 300 days
