Classified:    	  Marxism first developed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels has been the foremost ideology of the communist movement 

Classified:    	  Marxism considers itself to be the embodiment of scientific socialism rather than model an `` ideal society '' based on intellectuals design it is non-idealist attempt at the understanding of society and history through an analysis based in real life 

Classified:    	  Marxism does not see communism as `` state of affairs '' to be established but rather as the expression of real movement with parameters which are derived completely from real life and not based on any intelligent design 

Misclassified: 	  Marxism therefore does no blueprinting of communist society it only makes an analysis which concludes what will trigger its implementation and discovers its fundamental characteristics based on the derivation of real life conditions 

Classified:    	  At the root of Marxism is the materialist conception of history known as historical materialism for short 

Classified:    	  It holds that the key characteristic of economic systems through history has been the mode of production and that the change between modes of production has been triggered by class struggle 

Classified:    	  According to this analysis the Industrial Revolution ushered the world into new mode of production capitalism 

Misclassified: 	  Before capitalism certain working classes had ownership of instruments utilized in production 

Classified:    	  But because machinery was much more efficient this property became worthless and the mass majority of workers could only survive by selling their labor working through making use of someone else 's machinery and therefore making someone else profit 

Classified:    	  Thus with capitalism the world was divided between two major classes the proletariat and the bourgeoisie 

Classified:    	  These classes are directly antagonistic the bourgeoisie has private ownership of the means of production and earns profit off surplus value which is generated by the proletariat which has no ownership of the means of production and therefore no option but to sell its labor to the bourgeoisie 

Misclassified: 	  Historical materialism goes on and says the rising bourgeoisie within feudalism through the furtherance of its own material interests captured power and abolished of all relations of private property only the feudal privileges and with this took out of existence the feudal ruling class 

Classified:    	  This was another of the keys behind the consolidation of capitalism as the new mode of production which is the final expression of class and property relations and also has led into massive expansion of production 

Classified:    	  It is therefore only in capitalism that private property in itself can be abolished 

Classified:    	  The proletariat similarly will capture political power abolish bourgeois property through the common ownership of the means of production therefore abolishing the bourgeoisie and ultimately abolishing the proletariat itself and ushering the world into new mode of production communism 

Misclassified: 	  In between capitalism and communism there is the dictatorship of the proletariat democratic state where the whole of the public authority is elected and recallable under the basis of universal suffrage it is the defeat of the bourgeois state but not yet of the capitalist mode of production and at the same time the only element which places into the realm of possibility moving on from this mode of production 

Classified:    	  An important concept in Marxism is socialization vs. nationalization 

Classified:    	  Nationalization is merely state ownership of property whereas socialization is actual control and management of property by society 

Misclassified: 	  Marxism considers socialization its goal and considers nationalization tactical issue with state ownership still being in the realm of the capitalist mode of production 

Classified:    	  In the words of Engels `` the transformation 

Classified:    	  into State-ownership does not do away with the capitalistic nature of the productive forces 

Misclassified: 	  State-ownership of the productive forces is not the solution of the conflict but concealed within it are the technical conditions that form the elements of that solution ''

Misclassified: 	  Like so many other early writings of his German Ideology would not be published in Marx 's lifetime and would be published only in 1932 

Classified:    	  After completing German Ideology Marx turned to work that was intended to clarify his own position regarding `` the theory and tactics '' of truly `` revolutionary proletarian movement '' operating from the standpoint of truly `` scientific materialist '' philosophy 

Classified:    	  This work was intended to draw distinction between the utopian socialists and Marx 's own scientific socialist philosophy 

Misclassified: 	  Whereas the utopians believed that people must be persuaded one person at time to join the socialist movement the way person must be persuaded to adopt any different belief Marx knew that people would tend on most occasions to act in accordance with their own economic interests 

Classified:    	  Thus appealing to an entire class with broad appeal to the class 's best material interest would be the best way to mobilise the broad mass of that class to make revolution and change society 

Classified:    	  This was the intent of the new book that Marx was planning 

Classified:    	  However to get the manuscript past the government censors Marx called the book The Poverty of Philosophy and offered it as response to the `` petty bourgeois philosophy '' of the French anarchist socialist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon as expressed in his book The Philosophy of Poverty 

Classified:    	  These books laid the foundation for Marx and Engels 's most famous work political pamphlet that has since come to be commonly known as The Communist Manifesto 

Classified:    	  While residing in Brussels in 1846 Marx continued his association with the secret radical organisation League of the Just 

Classified:    	  As noted above Marx thought the League to be just the sort of radical organisation that was needed to spur the working class of Europe toward the mass movement that would bring about working class revolution 

Classified:    	  However to organise the working class into mass movement the League had to cease its `` secret '' or `` underground '' orientation and operate in the open as political party 

Classified:    	  Members of the League eventually became persuaded in this regard 

Classified:    	  Accordingly in June 1847 the League of the Just was reorganised by its membership into new open `` above ground '' political society that appealed directly to the working classes 

Classified:    	  This new open political society was called the Communist League
