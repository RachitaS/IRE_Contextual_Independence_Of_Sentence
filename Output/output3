Misclassified: 	  Others such as Philip Short reject such comparisons in Mao Life arguing that whereas the deaths caused by Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia were largely systematic and deliberate the overwhelming majority of the deaths under Mao were unintended consequences of famine 

Classified:    	  Short noted that landlord class were not exterminated as people due to Mao 's belief in redemption through thought reform 

Classified:    	  He instead compared Mao with 19th-century Chinese reformers who challenged China 's traditional beliefs in the era of China 's clashes with Western colonial powers 

Misclassified: 	  Short argues `` Mao 's tragedy and his grandeur were that he remained to the end in thrall to his own revolutionary dreams

Misclassified: 	  In their 832-page biography Mao The Unknown Story Jung Chang and Jon Halliday take very critical view of Mao 's life and influence

Classified:    	  If not half one-third or one-tenth50 milliondie. `` 

Misclassified: 	  Thomas Bernstein of Columbia University argues that this quotation is taken out of context claiming The Chinese original however is not quite as shocking 

Misclassified: 	  In the speech Mao talks about massive earthmoving irrigation projects and numerous big industrial ones all requiring huge numbers of people 

Classified:    	  If the projects he said are all undertaken simultaneously `` half of China 's population unquestionably will die and if it 's not half it 'll be third or ten percent death toll of 50 million people. ``

Misclassified: 	  But as fresh and abundant archival evidence shows coercion terror and systematic violence were the foundation of the Great Leap and between 1958 to 1962 by rough approximation some to per cent of those who died were tortured to death or summarily killedamounting to at least million victims 

Misclassified: 	  Countless others were deliberately deprived of food and consequently starved to death 

Misclassified: 	  Many more vanished because they were too old weak or sick to workand hence unable to earn their keep 

Misclassified: 	  People were killed selectively because they had the wrong class background because they dragged their feet because they spoke out or simply because they were not liked for whatever reason by the man who wielded the ladle in the canteen 

Classified:    	  Diktter argues that CPC leaders `` glorified violence and were inured to massive loss of life 

Classified:    	  And all of them shared an ideology in which the end justified the means 

Misclassified: 	  In 1962 having lost millions of people in his province Li Jingquan compared the Great Leap Forward to the Long March in which only one in ten had made it to the end 'We are not weak we are stronger we have kept the backbone. ''

Classified:    	  Jackson forcibly moved Native Americans resulting in thousands of deaths while Mao was at the helm during the violent years of the Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forward 

Misclassified: 	  Though admittedly far from perfect the comparison is based on the fact that Jackson is remembered both as someone who played significant role in the development of political organization that still has many partisans and as someone responsible for brutal policies toward Native Americans that are now referred to as genocidal 

Classified:    	  Both men are thought of as having done terrible things yet this does not necessarily prevent them from being used as positive symbols 

Classified:    	  And Jackson still appears on 20 bills even though Americans tend to view as heinous the institution of slavery and the early 19th-century military campaigns against Native Americans 

Misclassified: 	  At times Jackson for all his flaws is invoked as representing an egalitarian strain within the American democratic tradition self-made man of the people who rose to power via straight talk and was not allied with moneyed interests

Misclassified: 	  Because of the aptness of the metaphor the period from 1689 to 1750 was called `` the Augustan Age '' by critics throughout the 18th century 

Classified:    	  The literature of the period is overtly political and thoroughly aware of critical dictates for literature 

Misclassified: 	  It is an age of exuberance and scandal of enormous energy and inventiveness and outrage that reflected an era when English Scottish and Irish people found themselves in the midst of an expanding economy lowering barriers to education and the stirrings of the Industrial Revolution 

Classified:    	  It was during this time that poet James Thomson produced his melancholy The Seasons and Edward Young wrote his poem Night Thoughts though the most outstanding poet of the age is Alexander Pope 

Classified:    	  It is also the era that saw serious competition over the proper model for the pastoral

Classified:    	  In prose the earlier part of the period was overshadowed by the development of the English essay

Misclassified: 	  George Lillo and Richard Steele both produced highly moral forms of tragedy where the characters and the concerns of the characters were wholly middle class or working class

Classified:    	  The Licensing Act 1737 brought an abrupt halt to much of the period 's drama as the theatres were once again brought under state control 

Misclassified: 	  An effect of the Licensing Act of 1737 was to cause more than one aspiring playwright to switch over to writing novels 

Misclassified: 	  Henry Fielding began to write prose satire and novels after his plays could not pass the censors 

Misclassified: 	  In the interim Samuel Richardson had produced novel intended to counter the deleterious effects of novels in Pamela or Virtue Rewarded

Misclassified: 	  Tobias Smollett elevated the picaresque novel with works such as Roderick Random and Peregrine Pickle 

Classified:    	  Each of these novels represents formal and thematic divergence from the others 

Classified:    	  Each novelist was in dialogue and competition with the others and in sense the novel established itself as diverse and open-formed genre in this explosion of creativity 

Classified:    	  The most lasting effects of the experimentation would be the psychological realism of Richardson the bemused narrative voice of Fielding

Classified:    	  Hitler used personal magnetism and an understanding of crowd psychology to advantage while engaged in public speaking 

Misclassified: 	  Historians have noted the hypnotic effect of his rhetoric on large audiences and of his eyes in small groups 

Misclassified: 	  The author Alfons Heck former member of the Hitler Youth describes the reaction to speech by Hitler Although Hitler 's oratory skills and personal traits were generally received well by large crowds and at official events some who met Hitler privately noted that his appearance and demeanour failed to make lasting impression 

Misclassified: 	  Early followers included Rudolf Hess former air force ace Hermann Gring and army captain Ernst Rhm 

Classified:    	  Rhm became head of the Nazis paramilitary organisation the Sturmabteilung which protected meetings and attacked political opponents 

Misclassified: 	  critical influence on his thinking during this period was the Aufbau Vereinigung conspiratorial group of White Russian exiles and early National Socialists 

Classified:    	  The group financed with funds channelled from wealthy industrialists introduced Hitler to the idea of Jewish conspiracy linking international finance with Bolshevism 

Misclassified: 	  The effective power of the Provisional Government was challenged by the authority of an institution that claimed to represent the will of workers and soldiers and could in fact mobilize and control these groups during the early months of the revolution the Petrograd Soviet of Workers Deputies 

Misclassified: 	  The model for the soviet were workers councils that had been established in scores of Russian cities during the 1905 revolution 

Classified:    	  In February 1917 striking workers elected deputies to represent them and socialist activists began organizing citywide council to unite these deputies with representatives of the socialist parties 

Classified:    	  On 27 February socialist Duma deputies mainly Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries took the lead in organizing citywide council 

Classified:    	  The Petrograd Soviet met in the Tauride Palace the same building where the new government was taking shape 

Misclassified: 	  The leaders of the Petrograd Soviet believed that they represented particular classes of the population not the whole nation 

Classified:    	  They also believed Russia was not ready for socialism 

Misclassified: 	  So they saw their role as limited to pressuring hesitant `` bourgeoisie '' to rule and to introduce extensive democratic reforms in Russia 

Classified:    	  They met in the same building as the emerging Provisional Government not to compete with the Duma Committee for state power but to best exert pressure on the new government to act in other words as popular democratic lobby 

Classified:    	  The relationship between these two major powers was complex from the beginning and would shape the politics of 1917 

Classified:    	  The representatives of the Provisional Government agreed to `` take into account the opinions of the Soviet of Workers Deputies '' though they were also determined to prevent `` interference in the actions of the government '' which would create `` an unacceptable situation of dual power '' 

Classified:    	  In fact this was precisely what was being created though this `` dual power '' was the result less of the actions or attitudes of the leaders of these two institutions than of actions outside their control especially the ongoing social movement taking place on the streets of Russias cities in factories and shops in barracks and in the trenches and in the villages 

Misclassified: 	  series of political crises see the chronology below in the relationship between population and government and between the Provisional Government and the soviets undermined the authority of the Provisional Government but also of the moderate socialist leaders of the Soviet

Classified:    	  Nevertheless Kerensky still faced several great challenges highlighted by the soldiers urban workers and peasants who claimed that they had gained nothing by the revolution The political group that proved most troublesome for Kerensky and would eventually overthrow him was the Bolshevik Party led by Vladimir Lenin 

Classified:    	  Lenin had been living in exile in neutral Switzerland and due to democratization of politics after the February Revolution which legalized formerly banned political parties he perceived the opportunity for his Marxist revolution 

Classified:    	  Although return to Russia had become possibility the war made it logistically difficult 

Misclassified: 	  Eventually German officials arranged for Lenin to pass through their territory hoping that his activities would weaken Russia or even if the Bolsheviks came to power lead to Russia 's withdrawal from the war 

Classified:    	  Lenin and his associates however had to agree to travel to Russia in sealed train Germany would not take the chance that he would foment revolution in Germany 

Classified:    	  After passing through the front he arrived in Petrograd in April 1917 

Classified:    	  With Lenin 's arrival the popularity of the Bolsheviks increased steadily 

Classified:    	  Over the course of the spring public dissatisfaction with the Provisional Government and the war in particular among workers soldiers and peasants pushed these groups to radical parties 

Classified:    	  Despite growing support for the Bolsheviks buoyed by maxims that called most famously for `` all power to the Soviets '' the party held very little real power in the moderate-dominated Petrograd Soviet 

Classified:    	  In fact historians such as Sheila Fitzpatrick have asserted that Lenin 's exhortations for the Soviet Council to take power were intended to arouse indignation both with the Provisional Government whose policies were viewed as conservative and the Soviet itself which was viewed as subservient to the conservative government 

Classified:    	  By some historians accounts Lenin and his followers were unprepared for how their groundswell of support especially among influential worker and soldier groups would translate into real power in the summer of 1917 

Misclassified: 	  On 18 June the Provisional Government launched an attack against Germany that failed miserably 

Classified:    	  Soon after the government ordered soldiers to go to the front reneging on promise 

Classified:    	  The soldiers refused to follow the new orders 

Misclassified: 	  The arrival of radical Kronstadt sailors who had tried and executed many officers including one admiral further fueled the growing revolutionary atmosphere 

Classified:    	  The sailors and soldiers along with Petrograd workers took to the streets in violent protest calling for `` all power to the Soviets. `` 

Classified:    	  The revolt however was disowned by Lenin and the Bolshevik leaders and dissipated within few days 

Misclassified: 	  In the aftermath Lenin fled to Finland under threat of arrest while Trotsky among other prominent Bolsheviks was arrested 

Misclassified: 	  The July Days confirmed the popularity of the anti-war radical Bolsheviks but their unpreparedness at the moment of revolt was an embarrassing gaffe that lost them support among their main constituent groups soldiers and workers 

Misclassified: 	  The Bolshevik failure in the July Days proved temporary 

Misclassified: 	  The Bolsheviks had undergone spectacular growth in membership 

Misclassified: 	  Whereas in February 1917 the Bolsheviks were limited to only 24,000 members by September 1917 there were 200,000 members of the Bolshevik faction

Classified:    	  In response he ordered troops to Petrograd to pacify the city 

Classified:    	  To secure his position Kerensky had to ask for Bolshevik assistance 

Classified:    	  He also sought help from the Petrograd Soviet which called upon armed Red Guards to `` defend the revolution '' 

Classified:    	  The Kornilov Affair failed largely due to the efforts of the Bolsheviks whose influence over railroad and telegraph workers proved vital in stopping the movement of troops 

Classified:    	  With his coup failing Kornilov surrendered and was relieved of his position 

Misclassified: 	  The Bolsheviks role in stopping the attempted coup further strengthened their position 

Classified:    	  In early September the Petrograd Soviet freed all jailed Bolsheviks and Trotsky became chairman of the Petrograd Soviet 

Misclassified: 	  Growing numbers of socialists and lower-class Russians viewed the government less and less as force in support of their needs and interests 

Misclassified: 	  The Bolsheviks benefited as the only major organized opposition party that had refused to compromise with the Provisional Government and they benefited from growing frustration and even disgust with other parties such as the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries who stubbornly refused to break with the idea of national unity across all classes 

Classified:    	  In Finland Lenin had worked on his book State and Revolution and continued to lead his party writing newspaper articles and policy decrees 

Classified:    	  By October he returned to Petrograd aware that the increasingly radical city presented him no legal danger and second opportunity for revolution 

Classified:    	  Recognising the strength of the Bolsheviks Lenin began pressing for the immediate overthrow of the Kerensky government by the Bolsheviks
