Misclassified: 	  In addition cheap IBM PC clones that ran on Microsoft software and had graphical user interface began to appear 

Misclassified: 	  Although the Macintosh preceded the clones it was far more expensive so `` through the late '80s the Windows user interface was getting better and better and was thus taking increasingly more share from Apple 

Misclassified: 	  `` Windows based IBM-PC clones also led to the development of additional GUIs such as IBM 's TopView or Digital Research 's GEM and thus `` the graphical user interface was beginning to be taken for granted undermining the most apparent advantage of the Mac

Misclassified: 	  Sculley and Jobs 's visions for the company greatly differed 

Misclassified: 	  The former favored open architecture computers like the Apple II sold to education small business and home markets less vulnerable to IBM 

Misclassified: 	  Jobs wanted the company to focus on the closed architecture Macintosh as business alternative to the IBM PC 

Classified:    	  President and CEO Sculley had little control over chairman of the board Jobs 's Macintosh division it and the Apple II division operated like separate companies duplicating services 

Misclassified: 	  Although its products provided 85 of Apple 's sales in early 1985 the company 's January 1985 annual meeting did not mention the Apple II division or employees 

Classified:    	  Many left including Wozniak who stated that the company had `` been going in the wrong direction for the last five years '' and sold most of his stock 

Misclassified: 	  The Macintosh 's failure to defeat the PC strengthened Sculley 's position in the company 

Misclassified: 	  In May 1985 Sculley decided to reorganize Apple and proposed plan to the board that would remove Jobs from the Macintosh group and put him in charge of `` New Product Development. `` 

Classified:    	  This move would effectively render Jobs powerless within Apple

Misclassified: 	  Most playwrights of the period typically collaborated with others at some point and critics agree that Shakespeare did the same mostly early and late in his career 

Misclassified: 	  Some attributions such as Titus Andronicus and the early history plays remain controversial while The Two Noble Kinsmen and the lost Cardenio have well-attested contemporary documentation 

Classified:    	  Textual evidence also supports the view that several of the plays were revised by other writers after their original composition 

Misclassified: 	  The first recorded works of Shakespeare are Richard III and the three parts of Henry VI written in the early 1590s during vogue for historical drama 

Classified:    	  Shakespeare 's plays are difficult to date however and studies of the texts suggest that Titus Andronicus The Comedy of Errors The Taming of the Shrew and The Two Gentlemen of Verona may also belong to Shakespeare 's earliest period 

Classified:    	  His first histories which draw heavily on the 1587 edition of Raphael Holinshed 's Chronicles of England Scotland and Ireland dramatise the destructive results of weak or corrupt rule and have been interpreted as justification for the origins of the Tudor dynasty 

Classified:    	  The early plays were influenced by the works of other Elizabethan dramatists especially Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe by the traditions of medieval drama and by the plays of Seneca 

Classified:    	  The Comedy of Errors was also based on classical models but no source for The Taming of the Shrew has been found though it is related to separate play of the same name and may have derived from folk story 

Misclassified: 	  Like The Two Gentlemen of Verona in which two friends appear to approve of rape the Shrew 's story of the taming of woman 's independent spirit by man sometimes troubles modern critics and directors 

Misclassified: 	  Shakespeare 's early classical and Italianate comedies containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences give way in the mid-1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his most acclaimed comedies 

Classified:    	  Midsummer Night 's Dream is witty mixture of romance fairy magic and comic lowlife scenes 

Misclassified: 	  Shakespeare 's next comedy the equally romantic Merchant of Venice contains portrayal of the vengeful Jewish moneylender Shylock which reflects Elizabethan views but may appear derogatory to modern audiences 

Classified:    	  The wit and wordplay of Much Ado About Nothing the charming rural setting of As You Like It and the lively merrymaking of Twelfth Night complete Shakespeare 's sequence of great comedies 

Misclassified: 	  After the lyrical Richard II written almost entirely in verse Shakespeare introduced prose comedy into the histories of the late 1590s Henry IV parts and and Henry V. His characters become more complex and tender as he switches deftly between comic and serious scenes prose and poetry and achieves the narrative variety of his mature work 

Misclassified: 	  This period begins and ends with two tragedies Romeo and Juliet the famous romantic tragedy of sexually charged adolescence love and death and Julius Caesarbased on Sir Thomas North 's 1579 translation of Plutarch 's Parallel Liveswhich introduced new kind of drama 

Misclassified: 	  According to Shakespearean scholar James Shapiro in Julius Caesar `` the various strands of politics character inwardness contemporary events even Shakespeare 's own reflections on the act of writing began to infuse each other '' 

Misclassified: 	  In the early 17th century Shakespeare wrote the so-called `` problem plays '' Measure for Measure Troilus and Cressida and All 's Well That Ends Well and number of his best known tragedies 

Misclassified: 	  Many critics believe that Shakespeare 's greatest tragedies represent the peak of his art 

Classified:    	  The titular hero of one of Shakespeare 's most famous tragedies Hamlet has probably been discussed more than any other Shakespearean character especially for his famous soliloquy which begins `` To be or not to be that is the question '' 

Misclassified: 	  Unlike the introverted Hamlet whose fatal flaw is hesitation the heroes of the tragedies that followed Othello and King Lear are undone by hasty errors of judgement 

Classified:    	  The plots of Shakespeare 's tragedies often hinge on such fatal errors or flaws which overturn order and destroy the hero and those he loves 

Classified:    	  In Othello the villain Iago stokes Othello 's sexual jealousy to the point where he murders the innocent wife who loves him 

Misclassified: 	  In King Lear the old king commits the tragic error of giving up his powers initiating the events which lead to the torture and blinding of the Earl of Gloucester and the murder of Lear 's youngest daughter Cordelia 

Classified:    	  According to the critic Frank Kermode `` the play-offers neither its good characters nor its audience any relief from its cruelty '' 

Misclassified: 	  In Macbeth the shortest and most compressed of Shakespeare 's tragedies uncontrollable ambition incites Macbeth and his wife Lady Macbeth to murder the rightful king and usurp the throne until their own guilt destroys them in turn 

Classified:    	  In this play Shakespeare adds supernatural element to the tragic structure 

Classified:    	  His last major tragedies Antony and Cleopatra and Coriolanus contain some of Shakespeare 's finest poetry and were considered his most successful tragedies by the poet and critic T. S. Eliot 

Misclassified: 	  In his final period Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and completed three more major plays Cymbeline The Winter 's Tale and The Tempest as well as the collaboration Pericles Prince of Tyre 

Classified:    	  Less bleak than the tragedies these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors 

Classified:    	  Some commentators have seen this change in mood as evidence of more serene view of life on Shakespeare 's part but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day 

Classified:    	  Shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays Henry VIII and The Two Noble Kinsmen probably with John Fletcher 

Classified:    	  The settlements at Tilsit gave Napoleon time to organize his empire 

Classified:    	  One of his major objectives became enforcing the Continental System against the British 

Classified:    	  He decided to focus his attention on the Kingdom of Portugal which consistently violated his trade prohibitions 

Classified:    	  After defeat in the War of the Oranges in 1801 Portugal adopted double-sided policy 

Classified:    	  At first John VI agreed to close his ports to British trade 

Classified:    	  The situation changed dramatically after the Franco-Spanish defeat at Trafalgar John grew bolder and officially resumed diplomatic and trade relations with Britain 

Misclassified: 	  Unhappy with this change of policy by the Portuguese government Napoleon sent an army to invade Portugal 

Classified:    	  On 17 October 1807 24,000 French troops under General Junot crossed the Pyrenees with Spanish cooperation and headed towards Portugal to enforce Napoleon 's orders

Misclassified: 	  Throughout the winter of 1808 French agents became increasingly involved in Spanish internal affairs attempting to incite discord between members of the Spanish royal family 

Misclassified: 	  On 16 February 1808 secret French machinations finally materialized when Napoleon announced that he would intervene to mediate between the rival political factions in the country

Misclassified: 	  The shocking French defeat at the Battle of Bailn in July gave hope to Napoleon 's enemies and partly persuaded the French emperor to intervene in person 

Classified:    	  Before going to Iberia Napoleon decided to address several lingering issues with the Russians 

Misclassified: 	  At the Congress of Erfurt in October 1808 Napoleon hoped to keep Russia on his side during the upcoming struggle in Spain and during any potential conflict against Austria

Classified:    	  Napoleon would end up leaving Iberia in order to deal with the Austrians in Central Europe but the Peninsular War continued on long after his absence 

Classified:    	  He never returned to Spain after the 1808 campaign 

Misclassified: 	  Several months after Corunna the British sent another army to the peninsula under the future Duke of Wellington 

Classified:    	  The war then settled into complex and asymmetric strategic deadlock where all sides struggled to gain the upper hand 

Classified:    	  The highlight of the conflict became the brutal guerrilla warfare that engulfed much of the Spanish countryside 

Classified:    	  Both sides committed the worst atrocities of the Napoleonic Wars during this phase of the conflict 

Classified:    	  The vicious guerrilla fighting in Spain largely absent from the French campaigns in Central Europe severely disrupted the French lines of supply and communication 

Misclassified: 	  Although France maintained roughly 300,000 troops in Iberia during the Peninsular War the vast majority were tied down to garrison duty and to intelligence operations 

Classified:    	  The French were never able to concentrate all of their forces effectively prolonging the war until events elsewhere in Europe finally turned the tide in favor of the Allies 

Classified:    	  After the invasion of Russia in 1812 the number of French troops in Spain vastly declined as Napoleon needed reinforcements to conserve his strategic position in Europe 

Misclassified: 	  By 1814 after scores of battles and sieges throughout Iberia the Allies had managed to push the French out of the peninsula

Classified:    	  Marx contributed two essays to the paper `` Introduction to Contribution to the Critique of Hegel 's Philosophy of Right '' and `` On the Jewish Question '' the latter introducing his belief that the proletariat were revolutionary force and marking his embrace of communism 

Misclassified: 	  Only one issue was published but it was relatively successful largely owing to the inclusion of Heinrich Heine 's satirical odes on King Ludwig of Bavaria leading the German states to ban it and seize imported copies Ruge nevertheless refused to fund the publication of further issues and his friendship with Marx broke down 

Misclassified: 	  After the paper 's collapse Marx began writing for the only uncensored German-language radical newspaper left Vorwrts

Classified:    	  The study of political economy is study that Marx would pursue for the rest of his life and would result in his major economic workthe three-volume series called Capital 

Classified:    	  Marxism is based in large part on three influences Hegel 's dialectics French utopian socialism and English economics 

Misclassified: 	  Together with his earlier study of Hegel 's dialectics the studying that Marx did during this time in Paris meant that all major components of `` Marxism '' were in place by the autumn of 1844 

Misclassified: 	  Although Marx was constantly being pulled away from his study of political economy by the usual daily demands on his time that everyone faces and the additional special demands of editing radical newspaper and later by the demands of organising and directing the efforts of political party during years in which popular uprisings of the citizenry might at any moment become revolution Marx was always drawn back to his economic studies 

Misclassified: 	  Marx sought `` to understand the inner workings of capitalism. `` 

Misclassified: 	  An outline of `` Marxism '' had definitely formed in the mind of Karl Marx by late 1844 

Classified:    	  Indeed many features of the Marxist view of the world 's political economy had been worked out in great detail 

Classified:    	  However Marx needed to write down all of the details of his economic world view to further clarify the new economic theory in his own mind 

Classified:    	  Accordingly Marx wrote The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts 

Classified:    	  These manuscripts covered numerous topics detailing Marx 's concept of alienated labour 

Classified:    	  However by the spring of 1845 his continued study of political economy capital and capitalism had led Marx to the belief that the new political economic theory that he was espousingscientific socialismneeded to be built on the base of thoroughly developed materialistic view of the world 

Classified:    	  The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 had been written between April and August 1844 

Classified:    	  Soon though Marx recognised that the Manuscripts had been influenced by some inconsistent ideas of Ludwig Feuerbach 

Classified:    	  Accordingly Marx recognised the need to break with Feuerbach 's philosophy in favour of historical materialism 

Classified:    	  Thus year later in April 1845 after moving from Paris to Brussels Marx wrote his eleven Theses on Feuerbach The Theses on Feuerbach are best known for Thesis 11 which states that `` philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways the point is to change it '' 

Classified:    	  This work contains Marx 's criticism of materialism idealism overall criticising philosophy for putting abstract reality above the physical world 

Classified:    	  It thus introduced the first glimpse at Marx 's historical materialism an argument that the world is changed not by ideas but by actual physical material activity and practice 

Misclassified: 	  In 1845 after receiving request from the Prussian king the French government shut down Vorwrts with the interior minister Franois Guizot expelling Marx from France

Classified:    	  His supporters claim that he rapidly industrialised China however others have claimed that his policies such as the `` Great Leap Forward '' and the `` Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution '' were impediments to industrialisation and modernisation 

Classified:    	  His supporters claim that his policies laid the groundwork for China 's later rise to become an economic superpower while others claim that his policies delayed economic development and that China 's economy only underwent its rapid growth after Mao 's policies had been widely abandoned 

Classified:    	  Mao 's revolutionary tactics continue to be used by insurgents and his political ideology continues to be embraced by many Communist organizations around the world 

Classified:    	  In mainland China Mao is still revered by many supporters of the Communist Party and respected by the majority of the general population as the `` Founding Father of modern China '' credited for giving `` the Chinese people dignity and self-respect

Classified:    	  Gao also lauds Mao for carrying out massive land reform promoting the status of women improving popular literacy and positively `` transform Chinese society beyond recognition. `` 

Classified:    	  However Mao has many Chinese critics both those who live inside and outside China 

Classified:    	  Opposition to Mao is subject to restriction and censorship in mainland China but is especially strong elsewhere where he is often reviled as brutish ideologue 

Classified:    	  In the West his name is generally associated with tyranny and his economic theories are widely discreditedthough to some political activists he remains symbol against capitalism imperialism and western influence 

Misclassified: 	  Even in China key pillars of his economic theory have been largely dismantled by market reformers like Deng Xiaoping and Zhao Ziyang who succeeded him as leaders of the Communist Party 

Classified:    	  Though the Chinese Communist Party which Mao led to power has rejected in practice the economic fundamentals of much of Mao 's ideology it retains for itself many of the powers established under Mao 's reign it controls the Chinese army police courts and media and does not permit multi-party elections at the national or local level except in Hong Kong
